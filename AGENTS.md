# Repository notes for agents

<!-- These are the instructions for sessions working ON the BestPractice
     repo itself (the upstream). Inside a dependent repo's vendored copy
     (process/upstream/AGENTS.md) this file is inert — the dependent repo
     has its own instantiated AGENTS.md at ITS root. -->

**This repo is becoming Precedent, a restructuring of BestPractice — read
[PRACTICE_ENGINE_PLAN.md](PRACTICE_ENGINE_PLAN.md) first, in full, before
touching anything else here.** It is the approved plan of record; its "For
the Session Implementing This" section says how to work from it (phase by
phase, in order — do not read the whole plan trying to hold it all in
context at once; work from the phase you are on).
[spec/PRACTICE_FORMAT.md](spec/PRACTICE_FORMAT.md) documents the phase-1
practice-file format this repo's `practices/*.md` files are written in,
including where the actual conversion had to make a call the plan's own
illustrative example left open.

The rest of this file (below) is BestPractice's own pre-fork orientation —
still accurate for `PRACTICES.md`, `INSTALL.md`, and the rest of the
inherited tree, which the plan has not restructured yet. It will be rewritten
in place as later phases land (the plan's own generated-views work, phase 2)
rather than kept as a second, drifting copy.

---

**Orientation: read [README.md](README.md) first.** This repo is
BestPractice itself — the upstream practice layer that dependent repos
vendor. Practices you follow here are the ones this repo teaches; a session
that skips them in this repo of all places is the joke writing itself.

## Where things are (quick index — check here BEFORE searching)

| Looking for… | Go to |
|---|---|
| The restructuring plan (read this first) | [PRACTICE_ENGINE_PLAN.md](PRACTICE_ENGINE_PLAN.md) |
| The phase-1 per-practice file format | [spec/PRACTICE_FORMAT.md](spec/PRACTICE_FORMAT.md) |
| The converted practice files (phase 1) | [practices/](practices/) |
| What each practice is and why | [PRACTICES.md](PRACTICES.md) |
| Install / update / check-in playbook (dependent repos) | [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md) |
| Guided-install entry point admins paste to their agent | [SETUP.md](SETUP.md) |
| Member onboarding page (template + rendered sample) | [templates/GETTING_STARTED.md](templates/GETTING_STARTED.md) |
| Git/GitHub concepts for this workflow | [GIT.md](GIT.md) |
| The working method (branches, plain text, critique, prompts) | [METHOD.md](METHOD.md) |
| Phone / ChatGPT / Grok workflows + assistant reliability status | [MOBILE.md](MOBILE.md) |
| CI checks for shell-less agents (install, require) | [GITHUB_ACTIONS.md](GITHUB_ACTIONS.md) |
| Upstream open items / roadmap | [TODO.md](TODO.md) |
| GitAround — the reading view this work spun out | [alex137/GitAround](https://github.com/alex137/GitAround), a separate product since 2026-08-14; a branch here still staging it under proposals/ is superseded, and its documents live there now |
| Slide-deck engine + deck conventions | [deck/](deck/) — engine [build_deck.py](deck/build_deck.py), practice in [deck/README.md](deck/README.md) |
| Portable audits | [tools/](tools/) — [doc_lint.py](tools/doc_lint.py), [practice_audit.py](tools/practice_audit.py), [checkin.py](tools/checkin.py) |
| Skeletons dependent repos instantiate | [templates/](templates/) (+ per-agent adapters in [templates/harness/](templates/harness/)) |

## Working in this repo

- **Default branch is `main`; work on a feature branch; PRs are the norm**
  here (this repo is public and is the shared upstream).
- **Most changes arrive as check-in PRs from dependent repos** (INSTALL.md
  §4). Reviewing one, you are the **second scrub line**: the contributing
  repo's blocklist caught its known private vocabulary; you catch what it
  didn't know yet. A name, number, or incident detail that reads
  subject-specific rather than generic should be challenged before merge —
  and added to the contributor's blocklist, not fixed up here after
  publication.
- **Direct edits are fine** for content about this repo itself (README,
  practice wording, engine code); abstracted lessons still only enter via
  a scrubbed check-in from where they were learned.
- **Before committing:** `python3 tools/doc_lint.py` on markdown you
  touched (`pip install cmarkgfm` — the session-start hook does this);
  after touching the deck engine, rebuild the sample both ways:
  `python3 deck/build_deck.py deck/sample` and `--send`.

## Conventions (every session, every reply)

- **Reply convention** (practice 12): every reply that created or modified
  files ends with a **"Files touched"** list — for each file, the branch
  link (readable now) plus the post-merge `main` link, with a one-line
  description. The reader opens the work from the chat; they never go
  hunting for it. A touched HTML render or picture also gets its
  rendered-view (artifact) link when the harness offers one — a repo link
  shows source, not the render.
- **Doc references are links** (practice 11): relative markdown links,
  never bare backticked filenames. Use `≈`, not `~`, for "approximately".
- **Volatile rules carry their dates** (practice 16): anything asserted
  here about an external platform or tool carries *as of / verified
  `<date>`* inline, in the contributor's local calendar date, not the
  agent's system clock.
- **Outward-facing documents use the reader's words** (practice 34): this
  repo's README, [SETUP.md](SETUP.md), and
  [templates/GETTING_STARTED.md](templates/GETTING_STARTED.md) are read by
  people who are not developers. Terms that name a category are the
  reader's word, a plain equivalent, or glossed inline — never left to a
  glossary. Jargon arrives from the sources a session just read, so run
  the check as a separate pass after drafting.
- **Built decks are delivered** ([deck/README.md](deck/README.md)
  convention 3): a session that builds a deck attaches the HTML into the
  conversation as a viewable file in the same reply, and only ever sends
  the `--send` build externally.
